There are 2 goal for this repository.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item To list all the New\+Space Companies Wiki\+Pedia has a pretty detailed list of the new\+Space companies and what they do. But the list is not fully upto date. Normally I would edit and put in the details, but my University has proxy service for all web activities. Hence, my attempts are automatically blocked. I did create a google docs, but I think I\textquotesingle{}ll phase out that doc.
\item To learn Doxygen At the end of the day, I\textquotesingle{}m an E\+R\+TS engineer. What better way to practice new tools than to work on my side projects?
